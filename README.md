# Keyboard Tennis
An online tennis game created for my Code! 2 (Spring 2020) Final Project, taught by @CodingTrain. Migrated from code ditor p5.js.

# Instructions
Players must use the 'q' & 'a' keys to control the racket on the left side and the keys 'p' & ‘l' to control the racket on the right. The goal of the game is to reach 20 points. Once this number is reached, the game ends.

# Process
Initially, I wanted only one player but halfway through making this, I decided that I wanted to add an additional player because I thought 1 would be too boring. What I struggled with was the movement of the ball. At times, the ball would stay stagnant on the centre of the screen and would shake. Also, the ball would go faster when it would hit the right racket, but slower when it would hit the left racket,  After I resolved that issue, another one I encountered was that I could not get the number that represents what level the player is on to increase by 1. I wanted the level number to go up when the scores for both player 1 & 2 reached 5. Instead, the level number would go on forever. I spent several hours moving the code around to see if something would work, but it didn’t. It’s probably something really simple, but...
